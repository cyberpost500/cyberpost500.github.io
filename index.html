<h1 id="cyber-explorer-post-500">Cyber Explorer Post 500</h1>
<p>This is the github space for the Cyber Explorer Post 500 in Rome, New York.</p>
<p>We haven't decided what content would be useful to put up here, so for now, just head over to the <a href="modules/">module repository</a> and see what we have.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-place-and-time">Meeting Place and Time</h2>
<p>We meet at the Griffis Institute at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Griffiss+Institute/@43.212204,-75.398448,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6534a15939502b15!8m2!3d43.212204!4d-75.398448">725 Daedalian Dr, Rome NY</a>. We meet every other Tuesday from 2:30 to 4:00 pm year round. Though if school is canceled due to inclement weather or a holiday, then we also cancel meeting for that day.</p>
<p>We generally meet in the board room, but if that room is occupied, we may be in the conference room or the auditorium.</p>

<p>During our latest meetings we've been working on a simple Python game. It started out as a simple, but graphical hello world and now it's a playable (albeit simple) game.</p>
