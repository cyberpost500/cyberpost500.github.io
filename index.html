<p>This is the github space for the Cyber Explorer Post 500 in Rome, New York.</p>
<p>We haven't decided what content would be useful to put up here, so for now, just head over to the <a href="modules/">module repository</a> and see what we have.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-place-and-time">Meeting Place and Time</h2>
<p>We meet at the Rome Free Academy, every other Tuesday from 2:15 to 4:00 during the school year, in room 2200. We will likely resume meeting at the Griffis Institute over summer vacation.</p>
<p>If school is canceled due to inclement weather or a holiday, then we also cancel meeting for that day.</p>
<h2 id="future-meeting-dates">Future Meeting Dates</h2>

</ul>
<h1 id="what-have-we-been-up-to-lately">What have we been up to lately?</h1>
<p>It's a new year and we're just getting started. Tentative plans are to do some <a href="https://www.minetest.net">Minetest</a> modding, possibly some Android development, or whatever else the students want to work on.</p>
