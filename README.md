Cyber Explorer Post 500
=======================
This is the github space for the Cyber Explorer Post 500 in Rome, New York.

We haven't decided what content would be useful to put up here, so for now,
just head over to the [module repository](modules/) and see what we have.


Meeting Place and Time
----------------------
We meet at the Rome Free Academy, every other Tuesday from 2:15 to 4:00 during
the school year, in room 2200.  We will likely resume meeting at the Griffis
Institute over summer vacation.

If school is canceled due to inclement weather or a holiday, then we also
cancel meeting for that day.

Future Meeting Dates
--------------------

Note: We're having weekly meetings for at least the first month, then
re-evaluating the every other Tuesday schedule.

* Sep 19
* Sep 26
* Oct 3

What have we been up to lately?
==============================
It's a new year and we're just getting started.  Tentative plans are to do some
[Minetest](https://www.minetest.net) modding, possibly some Android
development, or whatever else the students want to work on.
