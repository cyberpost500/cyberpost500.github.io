Cyber Explorer Post 500
=======================
This is the github space for the Cyber Explorer Post 500 in Rome, New York.

We haven't decided what content would be useful to put up here, so for now,
just head over to the [module repository](modules/) and see what we have.


Meeting Place and Time
----------------------
We meet at the Rome Free Academy, every other Tuesday from 2:15 to 4:00 during
the school year, in room 2200.  We will likely resume meeting at the Griffis
Institute over summer vacation.

If school is canceled due to inclement weather or a holiday, then we also
cancel meeting for that day.

Future Meeting Dates
--------------------

* May 2
* May 16
* ...

What have we been up to lately?
==============================
During our latest meetings we've been doing some Linux command line
introduction, looking at the stuff on [over the
wire](http://overthewire.org) and porting the Python game we made to Java.
