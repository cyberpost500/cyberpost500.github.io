Cyber Explorer Post 500
=======================
This is the github space for the Cyber Explorer Post 500 in Rome, New York.

We haven't decided what content would be useful to put up here, so for now,
just head over to the [module repository](modules/) and see what we have.


Meeting Place and Time
----------------------
We meet at the Griffis Institute at [725 Daedalian Dr, Rome NY](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Griffiss+Institute/@43.212204,-75.398448,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6534a15939502b15!8m2!3d43.212204!4d-75.398448).
We meet every other Tuesday from 2:30 to 4:00 pm year round.  Though if school
is canceled due to inclement weather or a holiday, then we also cancel meeting
for that day.

We generally meet in the board room, but if that room is occupied, we may be in
the conference room or the auditorium.
